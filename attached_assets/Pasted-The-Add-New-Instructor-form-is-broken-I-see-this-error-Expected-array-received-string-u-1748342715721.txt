The Add New Instructor form is broken.

I see this error:
**"Expected array, received string"** under the Expertise field.

Please fix the form so that:
The expertise input is sent as an array, even if the user enters just one value (e.g., `["Design"]`)
Optionally allow adding multiple expertise values via comma-separated input or multi-tag field
The backend should accept an array of strings for the expertise field
Fix validation and show proper success/error messages

Also make sure the instructor is saved in the database and shown in the instructors list after saving.

Please test this end-to-end.
The Admin Dashboard is incomplete. I can’t access or manage any of the data shown in the cards (students, courses, lessons, etc.). Please do the following:

---

👤 STUDENT MANAGEMENT
- I see “Total Students: 3” but cannot click or view them.
- Create a section or page for:
  - Viewing all student profiles (email, enrolled courses, progress)
  - Editing or deleting a student
  - Assigning/removing courses
  - Optional: promoting a student to admin

---

📘 COURSE & LESSON DATA
- Even though the dashboard shows “Recent Activity” like “Python Data Science course updated,” those courses don’t exist in the system.
- Ensure activity log only shows real actions from the database.
- “Total Courses” and “Total Lessons” should reflect actual data saved, not dummy counters.

---

⚙️ DASHBOARD LINKS
- Make the “Total Students”, “Total Courses”, and “Total Lessons” boxes **clickable**, leading to full pages.
- Each page should list the records with sorting, search, and actions (edit/delete/view).
- Add missing routes if needed (`/admin/students`, `/admin/courses`, `/admin/lessons`).

---

🔐 ACCESS CONTROL
- These tools should only be visible to admins.
- Protect all related routes and pages with proper `is_admin` checks.

Please test everything end-to-end and confirm that I can view/edit/manage students, courses, and lessons directly from the dashboard.
